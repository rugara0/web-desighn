<p align='center'>Gosh. Men were interested in the female sexual organ. Who would have thought. The goddess comes
 primarily from the planet Venus coupled with Virgo. When Virgo was the astrological home of the summer </p>
<p align='left'>solstice, the goddess reigned supreme. She slipped out of that position starting in 4000 BCE or so when the summer
 solstice went 
into Leo which caused all kinds of problems as it did every few thousand years or so.</p>

<font color="green" size="4"> ><p align='right'>Religious stories from the Mideast were based on a supreme Lunar deity who would copulate 
with Venus, the last bright "star" in the sky and she would give birth to the sun god and go 
on to become her son's consort also. This astrological story gave rise to crazy psychological theories
 about men wanting to kill their father to marry their mother, instead of the cute little girl next door.
 This is the basis for Christianity.</p></font>
